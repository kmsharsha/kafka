## Terminology:
### Producer:

- Data is called as message in Kafka.

- Kafka can have many producers. This can be setup based on our requirement.

### Consumer:

- Producer sends data to Kafka server and Consumer will get the data from Kafka server.

- They can get data from more than one producers.

- If consumer goes down for any reason, when it comes back up it will start reading messages from where it last left.

### Broker:

- The producer and consumer interact using the Broker as an agent.

### Cluster:

- Group of Brokers form a cluster.

### Topic:

- A topic is unique name for a data stream.
- It is similar to a category to differentiate between the type of data sent.
